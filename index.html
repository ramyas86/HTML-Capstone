                        workout.</li>

                        mineral

                    <li><b>Easy-to-Digest:</b>Fiber is essential and offers many health benefits. Biscuits and
                        cookies are
                        easily digested. A low-fiber diet includes foods that are easy to digest, like Karachi
                        bakery
                        fruit biscuits.</li>
                    <li><b>Source of Calories:</b> If you are struggling to maintain or gain weight, you need a diet
                        with
                        calorie-dense foods. Foods that provide calories and nutrients without making you feel too
                        full.

                    <li><b>Provides Fiber:</b> Some other types of biscuits, like digestive biscuits, are designed
                        to provide
                        you with more fiber. The fiber in the biscuit comes from wheat bran which is found in most
                        digestive biscuits. Diets rich in fiber can help prevent constipation, lower cholesterol,
                        and
                        aid in weight management.</li>
